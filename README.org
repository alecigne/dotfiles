#+TITLE: Dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] symlink farm manager.

* About GNU Stow

** Quickstart

Just run :

#+begin_src sh
  stow emacs
#+end_src

This will treat the ~emacs~ directory as a Stow package and create
symlinks pointing to its content in the parent directory (here the
home directory).

** Slowstart

#+begin_src sh
  stow .
#+end_src

Stow the current package to the parent directory.

Some users treat their stow directory as a big, unique package. In
that case, ~stow .~ is useful.

I prefer to have a stow directory with multiple packages in it such as
~emacs~ or ~i3~. In my case, the ~stow .~ command would be useful only
/inside/ such a package:

#+begin_src sh
  cd emacs
  stow . -t ~
#+end_src

This stows the current package to the home directory thanks to the
~-t~ option (/target/). Otherwise the target directory would have been
the package's parent directory, ~~/.dotfiles~.

So in my case, I mostly use ~stow~ like this:

#+begin_src sh
  stow emacs
#+end_src

This stows the ~emacs~ package to the parent directory. This is by the
way equivalent to ~stow --stow emacs~, or ~stow -S emacs~.

#+begin_src sh
  stow -d ~/.dotfiles emacs
#+end_src

This is the same as above, but done from outside the stow
directory. Without the ~-d~ option, ~stow emacs~ could stow an ~emacs~
directory from your current location - this is not what you want.

To test these options you can use the ~-n~ flag. This will simulate
the changes without modify your file system. To see more than eventual
errors, use it in combination with the ~-v~ flag. A moderately
elaborate, stow command, mostly useless in my case :) :

#+begin_src sh
  cd emacs
  stow -n . -t ~ -v
#+end_src

Output :

#+begin_example
  stow dir is /home/alc/.dotfiles/emacs
  stow dir path relative to target /home/alc is .dotfiles/emacs
  Planning stow of package ....
  LINK: .emacs.d => .dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.d
  Planning stow of package .... done
  WARNING: in simulation mode so not modifying filesystem.
#+end_example

** Ignore lists

Files can be excluded from the stowing process using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/html_node/Ignore-Lists.html#Ignore-Lists][ignore lists]].

* Components

** cVim

[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh][cVim]], an extension adding Vim-like bindings to Google Chrome.

Just load this once in Chrome:

#+begin_example
  set localconfig
  let configpath = '/path/to/.cvimrc'
#+end_example

** Emacs

[[https://github.com/alecigne/.emacs.d][SwanEmacs]], my Org-based Emacs configuration, included as a submodule.

** i3

My config for the [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]] window manager, including my [[https://i3wm.org/i3status/manpage.html][i3status]]
configuration.

** Git

My [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] configuration. So far it only includes a selection of ~git~
aliases from the [[https://github.com/GitAlias/gitalias][gitalias]] repository, organized with ~org-babel~ for
more readability. Please go to the original source for reference.

*** Usage

**** Org

- Every section has a Noweb reference.

- Everything is then fed to a main code block through Noweb (see
  the bottom of the raw Org file).

- The result after ~org-babel-tangle~ is a ~.gitalias~ file.

**** Git

Add this to ~.gitconfig~ after generating ~.gitalias~ and stowing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [include]
  path = .gitalias
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Rofi

[[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][Rofi]], a window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement.

** SBCL

[[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]], a high performance Common Lisp compiler.

** Zsh

A great [[http://www.zsh.org/][shell]].
