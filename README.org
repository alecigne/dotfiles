#+title: Dotfiles

My dotfiles (see definition below), managed using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] symlink
farm manager.

This repo is used in conjunction with my [[https://github.com/alecigne/ansible-desktop][Ansible-based Debian
configuration]] to document/automate the setup/configuration of my
personal workstations.

* Dotfiles?

The idea of dotfiles is explained [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles][here]].

#+begin_quote
User-specific application configuration is traditionally stored in so
called dotfiles (files whose filename starts with a dot). It is common
practice to track dotfiles with a version control system such as Git
to keep track of changes and synchronize dotfiles across various
hosts.

* About GNU Stow

I use GNU Stow to manage symbolic links to my dotfiles. You can read a
short GNU Stow tutorial in my [[https://lecigne.net/notes/stow.html][public notes]] (also available [[https://github.com/alecigne/lecigne.net/blob/master/notes/stow.org][on Github]]
as a "source" Org file).

The =stow.bash= script automatically stows the packages in the home
directory.

** Wallpapers

Good resources:

- https://wallhaven.cc/
- https://unsplash.com/

[[file:wallpapers/.wallpapers/current][The 'current' file]] in my wallpapers directory is a symlink to [[file:wallpapers/.wallpapers/linux.jpeg][my
default wallpaper]]. When I stow my dotfiles, another symlink is created
in this way:

#+begin_example
  ~/.wallpapers/current -> ~/etc/dotfiles/wallpapers/.wallpapers/current
#+end_example

My i3 config always loads =~/.wallpapers/current=, so I always have a
default wallpaper when I [[https://github.com/alecigne/ansible-desktop][generate a new environment]].

[[https://github.com/alecigne/alc-utils/blob/master/pywallpaper.py][This script]], in my personal utils, downloads a random wallpaper and
make the current symlink above point to it.

** Xmodmap

My [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xmodmap][Xmodmap]] config.

** Zsh

A great [[http://www.zsh.org/][shell]].
